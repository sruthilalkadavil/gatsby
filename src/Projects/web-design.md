**HTML**,
  HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.
  It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website, so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career in web development.
  Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items
  Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format
  Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.

# CSS
 CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
 CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
